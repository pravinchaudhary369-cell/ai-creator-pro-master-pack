✦ QUICK START GUIDE

This section shows you exactly how to use your pack effectively.
Follow these 4 simple steps to get immediate results and income potential from day one.


---

Step 1: Open an AI Platform

Use any AI tool such as:

ChatGPT (for text, ideas, automation)

Claude / Gemini / Notion AI (for writing & business)

Leonardo / Midjourney / Ideogram / Canva (for design & visuals)


These tools accept prompts directly — simply copy any Smart Prompt from this pack, edit placeholders [like this], and paste it into the AI chat.


---

Step 2: Customize the Placeholders

Each Smart Prompt includes a few words inside brackets [ ] — replace them with your topic, niche, product, or idea.

Example:

> “Generate 5 Instagram post ideas for [fitness brand]”
➡ Replace [fitness brand] with your own focus: “organic skincare”, “freelance agency”, etc.



That’s it — AI will instantly output complete, usable results tailored to you.


---

Step 3: Apply the Universal Template System

Once your prompt gives output, use the Template System (see Part 3) to:

Choose color tones and brand emotion

Pick text styles or voice tones

Refine your visuals or content for brand consistency


This step transforms raw AI output into market-ready, premium results.


---

Step 4: Monetize Effortlessly

Use these prompts and tools to:

Build social media content faster

Offer branding, ad, and automation services

Create ebooks, templates, and design packs for resale

Leverage the AI Tool Pack’s referral system (affiliate income)


You can earn in three ways:
1️⃣ Sell your AI-generated work (designs, posts, ebooks).
2️⃣ Offer services using these prompts.
3️⃣ Earn affiliate commissions when others use tools via your referral links.
